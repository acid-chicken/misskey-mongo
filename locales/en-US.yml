  title: "How to use Misskey"
  step1_1: "Welcome!"
  step1_2: "This page is called \"timeline\". It shows chronologically ordered \"notes\" of people who you \"follow\"."
  step1_3: "Your timeline is currently empty, since you have not posed any notes or followed anyone yet."
  step2_1: "Let's finish setting up your profile before writing a note or following anyone."
  step2_2: "Providing some information about who you are will make it easier for others to follow you back."
  step3_1: "Finished setting up your profile?"
  step3_2: "The next step is to post a note. You can do this by pressing a pencil icon on the screen."
  step3_3: "Fill in the modal and press the button on the right top to post."
  step3_4: "Have nothing to say? Try \"I just started Misskey!\""
  step4_1: "Finished posting your first note?"
  step4_2: "Hurray! Now your first note is displayed on your timeline."
  step5_1: "Now, let's try making your timeline more lively by following other people."
  step5_2: "{featured} will show you trending notes in this instance. {explore} will let you find trending users. Try following people you like!"
  step5_3: "To follow other users, click on their icon and press \"follow\" button on their profile."
  step5_4: "If the other user has a lock icon next to their name, that user will have to manually approve your follow request."
  step6_1: "Now you will be able to see other users' notes on your timeline."
  step6_2: "You can also put \"reactions\" on other people's notes to quickly respond."
  step6_3: "To attach a \"reaction\", press \"+\" mark on other user's note and choose an emoji you'd like to react with."
  step7_1: "Congratulations! You have now finished Misskey's basic tutorial."
  step7_2: "If you would like to learn more about Misskey, try the {help} section."
  step7_3: "Good luck and have fun! üöÄ"

For example, source text <b>Hello { thing } world!</b> with <b> ai </b> as the value of variable 'thing' will result in the text being <b>Hello ai world!</b>."
  variables-info2: "Because the evaluation of variables are performed from top to bottom, the variable cannot refer to another variables which appear on later lines. For example, when defining three variables <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>, variable <b>C</b> <i>can</i> refer to variables <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> in its expression. However, variable <b>A</b> <i>cannot</i> refer to variables <b>B</b> or <b>C</b> in its expression."
  variables-info3: "To get an input from user, insert \"user input\" block with your desired variable name (that variable will be declared automatically). You could then use that variable to perform actions on your page."
  variables-info4: "Functions make it easier to perform repetitive tasks. To create a function, declare a variable of \"Function\" type. A function can have a slot (argument/parameter) which can be used inside the function as a variable. Thanks to AiScript specification, you can also use function itself as a parameter for other functions. (Search \"callback functions\" on google for more details)."
